# README

This is a TODO api only Rails application. This application is a demonstration of how we can use optic to document the API.

# Setup 
* Database creation
    `rails db:create`

* Database initialization
    `rails db:migrate`

* start the optic server
    `api start`
    This will start the server in port 4000. Make requests to this port for the APIs.
